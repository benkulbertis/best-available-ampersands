== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the point of this plugin? =

A really popular idea (originally crafted by Dan Cederholm) is that it looks really nice if one uses
a special font for ampersands, generally fonts that are known for fancy ampersands such as Baskerville and
Palatino Linotype. This is sometimes tiresome to implement, so this plugin does it for you!
